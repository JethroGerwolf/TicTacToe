# Overview
I made a UI Game that Plays tic tac toe with the computer. I used C# and .Net  to create the game. The computer is dumb but it works and can win by chance or if the player makes a mistake. But this is tic tac toe the game normally goes to a cats game no matter what for the most part.

I mainly made this game to learn how to program with C# and .Net. I also wanted to make a game that I could play with my friends and family. I also wanted to learn how to make a UI application with C# and .Net.

# Demo of the game!!!!

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio 2022 to develop the software. I also used .Net 8.0 to create the application. I used C# as the programming language. I also used GitHub to host the code and to track changes.
